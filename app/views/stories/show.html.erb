				<P>come to Blood Bikes Wales' new website and thanks must go to Jonathan Hurley Design for doing such a great job. Thanks also to our volunteers that have worked alongside to help create this site. I'm sure you'll find it's easier to navigate and that there's a lot more information at your fingertips. It's easier to communicate through our contact buttons as well, ensuring you get the answers you need from the best person to help you. We're continually seeking ways to improve our organisation, be it the service we provide, the way to fund-raise or how we look after our members. Any suggestions you may have are always welcomed.</p>
